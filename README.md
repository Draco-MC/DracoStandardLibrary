# DracoStandardLibrary

This mod provides essential mixins, hooks, and APIs to assist modders with writing mods. Most mod loaders that people have attempted to create have had a main focus on client mods. Draco, focuses on both client and server-side features, with the goal of being able to create mods similar to the complexity that mods with Fabric can have, the main difference being Draco would be majorly smaller and simpler than the Fabric API. This is accomplishable due to the improvements on the ease of modding in the newer version, making it easier for modders to interact with the game, leading to less mixins and APIs being needed to add features. Though the library still has enough features for a developer to write a complete mod without any other dependencies.

Nearly every mod will not work without this API, and is required for proper functionality.
